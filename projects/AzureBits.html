		<hr />

		<div>
			AzureBits is a school project given to me for my IT class in high-school. The project
			was originally thought for a web interface on a web browser. This is a simpler version
			made before we knew anything about web development It was used to evaluate my proficiency
			with java and sql
			<br /><br />
			This program has to simulate a multi-choice test on the CLI There are three levels of
			users that can enter login into the system, each can do different things
			<ul>
				<li>
					Administrator
					<ul>
						<li>manage all the users in the system: create, delete, edit</li>
						<li>manage all the classes in the system: create, delete, edit</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Teacher
					<ul>
						<li>manage their question: create, delete, edit</li>
						<li>manage their test: crate, delete, edit</li>
						<li>review assigned test and evaluate them</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Student
					<ul>
						<li>complete the given tests</li>
						<li>review all the corrected tests that have been ever taken</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			All of these users must be already registered in the system and must login with a
			password The program must be able to identify each user with their passwords, and
			identify their user level and present the right menu with the right options
